# DevOps Task 4 ‚Äî Version-Controlled Fantastic Beasts Website

This repository demonstrates Git version control best practices in a DevOps workflow. 
It contains a small static website themed around the "Fantastic Beasts" movie series 
(Harry Potter prequel), showing how feature branches, pull requests, and version tagging work.

## Project Objective
- Learn and apply Git branching strategies (`main`, `dev`, feature branches)
- Create pull requests and merge features systematically
- Tag versions for milestones (v1.0, v2.0)
- Deploy a static website using GitHub Pages

## Website Structure
- **Version 1.0 (v1.0):**  
  - Landing page (`index.html`) with movie poster  
  - About page (`about.html`) with detailed movie info

- **Version 2.0 (v2.0):**  
  - Contact page (`contact.html`) with project creator info  

All pages share a common CSS file (`assets/css/style.css`) for consistent styling.

## Branch Strategy
- `main` ‚Äî production-ready code, always stable  
- `dev` ‚Äî integration branch for feature testing  
- `feature1-about` ‚Äî adds the About page  
- `feature2-contact` ‚Äî adds the Contact page
